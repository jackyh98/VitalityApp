Mix it well with a wooden spoon.\n\nStep 3: Heat up a large non-stick skillet over medium high heat. I use my 12 inch non-stick skillet to make one big pancake, but if your skillet is small, you can work in batches to make smaller ones. \n\nStep 4: Add about 2 tablespoons vegetable oil and swirl it around to coat the skillet evenly. Add the batter to the skillet and spread it out evenly. \n\nStep 5: Turn down the heat to medium and put the sliced mushroom on top. Gently press them in with a wooden spoon or spatula. \n\nStep 6: Cook for 4 to 5 minutes until the bottom turns crunchy light golden brown. Grab the handle of the skillet and twirl it around so the pancake moves and is cooked evenly underneath. \n\nStep 7: Turn or flip over the pancake. \n\nStep 8: Increase the heat to medium high and add 1 to 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil along the edges of the pancake. Lift up one edge with your spatula and tilt the skillet so the oil flows underneath the pancake. \n\nStep 9: Cook for 3 to 4 minutes until both sides turn light golden brown, occasionally pressing down with the spatula. \n\nStep 10: Flip it over one more time and cook another 2 minutes.
