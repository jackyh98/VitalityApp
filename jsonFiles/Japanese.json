  "instruction": "Step 1: In a large saucepan over medium heat, heat the oil. Add the scallions, garlic, carrot, mushrooms, and cabbage. Cook, stirring often, for 3 minutes, or until the vegetables soften. Stir in the ginger and brown sugar and cook for 30 seconds. Finally add the chicken broth and bring to a simmer. Simmer for 10 minutes. \n\nStep 2: While the broth is simmering, bring a pot of water to a boil. Set a bowl of cold ice water nearby. Use a slotted spoon to gently lower the eggs, still in the shell, into the water. Simmer for 7 minutes for eggs that are soft and a little runny in the center, or 9 minutes for hard-boiled eggs. Transfer the eggs to the bowl of cold water and set aside until ready to serve. \n\nStep 3: Return the pot of water to a boil. Add the noodles and cook for 3 minutes, or according to the package directions, until tender. Drain in a colander. \n\nStep 4: Divide the noodles among 4 large bowls. Ladle the broth and vegetables over the noodles. Remove the eggs from the ice water. Tap the shells with a spoon to crack and then peel off the shells. Pat the eggs dry and cut them in half. Top each bowl with the egg halves and the sliced chicken. Serve with soy sauce, hot sauce, cilantro leaves and lime wedges.",
